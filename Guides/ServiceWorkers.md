# Service Workers

> Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available). They are intended, among other things, to enable the creation of effective offline experiences, intercept network requests and take appropriate action based on whether the network is available, and update assets residing on the server. They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs. Says MDN

## About this guide

Here We have two approaches to follow. One specifically to PWAs i.e. How service workers enables offline experience. Another, service workers in general. I am following two guides first one is GWFs which is more directed towards using service workers. Another is MDN, which is all about service workers.
