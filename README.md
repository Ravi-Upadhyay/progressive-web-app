# Progressive Web Application - Future of Web

This project is about development of progressive web application. This is Research & Development Project.
Objective is to have one place to learn, experiment and store notes for future reference.


## What are Progressive Web Application

According to [Google Web Fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/):

> Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:

_Reliable_ - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.

_Fast_ - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.

_Engaging_ - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.
This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user's home screen.

### Components of PWA:

1. [Service Workers]()
2. [Web App Manifest](WebAppManifest)

2. [Web App Manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/)


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
