# Progressive Web Application - Future of Web

This project is about development of progressive web application. This is Research & Development Project.
Objective is to have one place to learn, experiment and store notes for future reference.


## What are Progressive Web Application

According to [Google Web Fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/):

> Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:

_Reliable_ - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.

_Fast_ - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.

_Engaging_ - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.
This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user's home screen.

### Components of PWA:

1. [Service Workers](ServiceWorkers.md)
2. [Web App Manifest](WebAppManifest.md)
3. [Web Push Notification]()

### Why PWA? 

*  Worthy of being on home screen
*  Work reliably, no matter what network conditions
*  Increased Engagement
*  Improved Conversions

### Structure

Here we will follow [Google Web Fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/)'s Complete Tutorial.

* __Core Foundation of delightful web experience.__ _Together we can remember "FIRE"_
    - Fast
    - Integrated
    - Reliable 
    - Engaging
* __App Shell Model__
    - The App Shell Architecture is one way to build PWA. The App "shell" is the minimal HTML, CSS and Javascript required to power the user interface and when cached offline can ensure __instant, reliably good
    performance__.[App Shell](AppShellModel)
